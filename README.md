# Sign Language Recognition: Data Collection, Model Training, and Real-Time Detection

This project enables **real-time hand gesture recognition for sign language** using computer vision and deep learning. It is structured into three main stages—data collection, model training, and live detection—making it easy to adapt and extend for educational, accessibility, or research purposes.

## 1. Data Collection

The first step is to gather clear, labeled images for each target sign (e.g., "Hello", "Thank you", "Yes"). A provided script guides you through capturing images via your webcam.

**How Data Collection Works:**
- The webcam continuously captures frames.
- Using `cvzone.HandTrackingModule`, hands are detected in real time.
- For each detected hand:
  - The hand region is cropped with an adjustable margin.
  - The crop is resized and centered on a white 300x300 pixel canvas so all images have a consistent appearance.
  - Press `s` to save current cropped image to the dataset folder, organized by gesture and left/right hand.
- **Images are automatically labeled** by gesture name and hand type for streamlined model training.

This process ensures a consistent, well-structured dataset: every image is centered, uniformly sized, and organized for later machine learning.

## 2. Model Training

After collecting sufficient images (hundreds or thousands per class), you train a model to recognize each sign.

**Training Steps:**
- Organize your images into folders by sign class.
- Train a classifier (typically a CNN) using any preferred deep learning toolkit (such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch). Tools like [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) can also be used for fast prototyping.
- Once trained, export the model (e.g., `keras_model.h5`) and a `labels.txt` file mapping output indices to sign names.

**Model Efficiency:**
- High accuracy in recognition depends on data quality: ensure varied lighting, backgrounds, and hand orientations.
- Lightweight models deliver fast, real-time inference on most PCs—well-suited for interactive sign language applications.
- With quality training data, this approach routinely achieves >90% accuracy for static American Sign Language (ASL) signs.

## 3. Real-Time Detection

The detection script uses your webcam to recognize and display hand signs live.

**How It Works:**
- The video feed is processed frame-by-frame.
- Detected hands are cropped and resized exactly as during data collection.
- The trained classification model predicts the current sign, showing the result and its confidence score directly on the live video.

## 4. Applications

- **Sign Language Recognition:** Automatically translate gestures into readable text to assist communication for the deaf and hard of hearing.
- **Educational Tools:** Help students learn/practice sign language interactively.
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Enable gesture-driven commands for accessibility apps, devices, or robotics.
- **Data Science Projects:** Provides a practical platform for exploring computer vision, machine learning, and gesture analytics.

## Sample Workflow

1. **Run Data Collection Script:** Capture multiple labeled images per gesture.
2. **Train Model:** Use collected images to build and export your classifier and labels.
3. **Run Detection Script:** Experience live gesture recognition with visual feedback.
